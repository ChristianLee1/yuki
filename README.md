# Yuki
Yuki is a responsive masonry style theme for Tumblr by [@corygibbons](http://twitter.com/corygibbons).  

## Notes
Currently the theme works best for photo based blogs. At the moment all post types are supported but some work better than others, will create better support in the future when I have time.

## Install
Copy paste all contents from [yuki.html](https://raw.github.com/corygibbons/yuki/master/yuki.html) into your Tumblr customization window.

## Demo
Demo available at [yuki-theme.tumblr.com](http://yuki-theme.tumblr.com)
